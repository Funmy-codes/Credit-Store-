Credit Score Analysis


In this project I analyse and processed a credit score data. The main goal of this project was to clean, process, and explore the dataset to extract meaningful insights that can help in predicting or understanding credit scores.
While cleaning the dataset  I made sure I removed unwanted characters from columns
I also seperated the categorical and numerical data for specific analysis and processing
Data Insights from both the numerical and categorical data were drawn to understand the distribution and correlation of key features related to credit scores.
